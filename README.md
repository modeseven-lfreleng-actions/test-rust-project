Sample Rust project used for testing actions that build, package or
publish Rust crates, such as
[rust-crate-publish-action](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/rust-crate-publish-action).

## test-rust-project

A single crate, `lfreleng-test-rust-project`, with a library, a small
binary and tests. It stays minimal on purpose, so that actions tested
against it exercise their own behaviour rather than a complex build:

- No dependencies, so building it needs no crate downloads.
- A committed `Cargo.lock`, so every Cargo command runs with `--locked`.
- Complete crates.io metadata, so packaging reports no warnings.
- An `include` list that keeps the packaged `.crate` to the sources,
  tests, this README and the licence.

The crate is not for publication. Consuming workflows run
`cargo publish --dry-run` against it, which reads the crates.io index
but uploads nothing.

## Usage in action tests

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD046 -->

```yaml
- name: "Checkout test project"
  uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
  with:
    repository: "lfreleng-actions/test-rust-project"
    ref: "<commit-sha>"
    path: "test-rust-project"
    persist-credentials: false
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 MD046 -->

Pin `ref` to a commit SHA, so a change here cannot alter the results
of a consuming workflow unannounced.

## Building locally

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
cargo package --locked
cargo run -- Cargo
```

`.github/workflows/testing.yaml` runs the same checks on every pull
request, followed by `cargo publish --dry-run`.
