# Decides whether a language's root-level tooling applies to this checkout.
#
# Usage: manifest-guard.sh [--list] <manifest> <source-pathspec>...
#   GUARD_EXCLUDE  optional extended regex of source paths to ignore
#
# With --list it prints the tracked sources the root manifest owns as a
# NUL-delimited stream, for `xargs -0`, and exits 0. It is not
# line-oriented: a caller reading it as lines would split any path
# containing whitespace. A formatter needs that list because it rewrites
# files directly: `golangci-lint fmt` walks every Go file beneath the
# working directory and does not stop at module boundaries, so on a
# repository holding both a root and a nested module it would reformat
# the nested module with the root settings while `go mod tidy` updated
# only the root, leaving the nested module stale. Passing the owned set
# explicitly keeps the formatter inside the module it belongs to.
#
# Exit codes:
#   3  a root manifest is tracked and owns at least one source: run the tool
#   4  a root manifest is tracked but owns no source. Tools that only touch
#      the manifest, or that are no-ops without sources, should still run;
#      analysis tools must skip, because `go vet ./...` exits 1 and
#      `golangci-lint run` exits 5 on a module with nothing to analyse, which
#      would block the very commit that removes the last Go file.
#   0  the language is absent, or every tracked source lives under a manifest
#      in a subdirectory, so the root-level hook is inert
#   1  tracked sources exist that no tracked manifest covers
#
# Paths come from git with core.quotePath disabled, because the default
# C-quotes anything non-ASCII: a tracked tools/café/go.mod would arrive
# wrapped in quotes and match no prefix, so its sources would be reported
# as uncovered. A tracked path containing a literal newline is still not
# supported; git quotes those regardless, and the quoted form matches no
# prefix, so such a file is reported as uncovered and the hook fails
# rather than skipping silently.
#
# Every test is against the git index rather than the filesystem. A
# pre-commit hook validates what is being committed, so an untracked
# manifest sitting on disk must not satisfy it: a commit carrying sources
# but not their manifest would otherwise pass locally and land a tree
# nobody else can build.
#
# One computation serves both questions. "Unnested" below is the set of
# tracked sources that do not sit under a manifest in a subdirectory. When a
# root manifest is tracked those are the sources it owns; when none is
# tracked they are sources no manifest covers at all. Deciding coverage per
# file, rather than asking whether a nested manifest exists anywhere, is what
# stops a nested module masking deletion of the root manifest while sources
# outside it go unlinted.
